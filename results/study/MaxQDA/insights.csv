5d3f70a35a9deb001a5cc335,adjMatrix,I find it interesting that Jeffrey has the most followers and a decent number of neighbors at 27. I also think it's interesting his neighbors are primarily North American and European and mostly persons and not institutions. This makes me wonder of persons in developed countries have more access to Twitter and if this is why Jeffrey's followers consist of persons from that region.,6,3,,6.383333333,0.65625,62.08333333,33,Bachelors,Male,1,I was a bit confused with how the data is organized on this visualization. While the training video helped to understand the gist of the visualization tool I felt that I learned how to work with the tool by using the tool and yet I was not 100 percent comfortable completing the tasks because I felt I needed more training.,I appreciated that the videos had subtitles and the the speakers narrated the explanation in slow clearly spoken English.

I also was able to simply understand the information a bit better without using the sorting tools nearing the end making some of the tasks a bit easier than if I had the same one near the beginning.,,6

Although there were some easy questions the hard questions were very hard. It was kind of stressful for me because I didn't know how to answer and I didn't want to answer wrong. ,I was following for the first half of the video but I had to watch the second half twice.

The institutions generally seem to have fewer tweets than the people but they also seem to be more likely to have a large number of followers in spite of having few tweets (with a few exceptions people with few tweets generally have few followers). It also seems that the European accounts seem to have more of a tendency to have few followers and few tweets -- maybe this suggests that Twitter is less widely-used in their countries?,5,4,,7.016666667,0.890625,50.2,23,Bachelors,Female,4,Overall I found the matrix very interesting to use.

59789555a0b66b0001ea69ea,adjMatrix,I like the way that it is possible to study the people or institutions that are users of this network just by interacting with this framework. ,7,4,As a task with such freedom I believe that I explored and satisfied my curiosity and so my answers. whatever it is is correct,5,0.729166667,64.48333333,21,Bachelors,Male,5,"In general I think the tasks were easy but I had some doubts in some of the questions and the ""help"" section wasn't enough to clarify my doubts.",For me the training videos were very useful but it was a too quickly explanation to get some of the most complex concepts like the clusters,5

58c84d506d1c600001a09319,adjMatrix,Jeffery has absurdly large amount of followers yet his amount of tweets are on low side. In addition his account is not from insistutional side nor does he have many mentions from many people. His account growth is purely inorganic meaning he probably bought those followers to articially boost his amount of followers.,7,1,,2.483333333,0.390625,33.63333333,25,Bachelors,Male,1,,,7
581649f0b434f0000184d2a9,adjMatrix,It is interesting to see how many people know each other. It is also interesting to see how most of the time someone's tweets usually correspond roughly with how many followers they have- but that some could still have an average amount with a lot of followers- showing status (fame) could be important. I was also somewhat surprised to see that the EU and North America made up most of the chart. It was cool to see how connected everything is. ,7,2,,2.183333333,0.5625,55.91666667,26,Bachelors,Female,4,The introduction tasks were really helpful it was fascinating to see what the network would look like and how connected some things are while others are so spread out.

57ca4b09993b08000192297b,adjMatrix,The scales on the right hand side of the screen are not accurate guides to the number of tweets or followers or the account ages that appear in tooltips when the bars are hovered over. For example if the scale is 0 to 1000 some of the bars will look like they are just under 1000 but they are actually meant to represent a number larger than that like Jeffrey's followers at 1194.Other than that the only odd thing that stands out to me is that EVis19 has a lot of interactions for a new account with few tweets or followers.,3,4,I'm not really sure what I was supposed to spot.,8.933333333,0.84375,51.46666667,25,Bachelors,Female,5,I disliked that the sort function on each of the columns on the right didn't work in reverse (least first) after a second click. The scales for the numbers in these columns were also misleading and I went into detail on this in the answer to the final part of the task. I would have liked more tools to sort the data using something with the functionality of SQL sorting.,"Clustering was not explained in enough detail and the ""help"" button in the task didn't go into detail on it.

One of my only complaints would be that sometimes the data popup bubbles when hovering with my cursor did not appear above the cursor but somewhere else. The font was also small. This is one of the more unique and stimulating studies I have participated in on Prolific and I am grateful that I could be a part of it.,The training videos gave the necessary instructions to grasp the material and being able to go back was useful.,7
58d81a664240e5000118ff51,nodeLink,Jeffrey hasn't made many Tweets (less than a thousand) yet has a lot of followers and a fairly long account age. Andrea and Mandy are two people who do not have much social influence but are connected with him.,6,1,,1.466666667,0.8,39.75,29,Masters,other,1,This is definitely one of the more interesting and intriguing studies I've done! I'm curious to see what it's testing for.,I don't think I could have attempted this without these training materials honestly.,5
58e95834f3f183000171167a,nodeLink,I would have assumed that a high follower count would also mean a high tweets count; however in many instances I can see that this is not true. Most notably MViews stands out.,2,6,,2.5,0.9375,32.43333333,21,High School,Male,4,I have a 1600x900 monitor yet in the practice section of the study the tutorial popup instructions were off to the right side of my screen. I was full screen the whole time so that needs to be fixed in the future.,The practice examples were more helpful.,3
5922db5cb43a8300015df898,nodeLink,Jeffrey and Robert are connected to nearly everyone on the network.,6,2,I clicked some of the nodes and seen what was connected.,1.066666667,0.953125,37.75,37,High School,Female,2,I preferred the nodes that had the thick lines and the colorful nodes it was easier to understand.,I think that the training video helped to understand what the network was about.,6
59497b268bb5730001d4fe2f,nodeLink, the accounts with the most interactions are North American,5,7,,2.416666667,0.875,42.98333333,31,High School,Female,4,I actually enjoyed it might look into it more in the future,,7

596d9b437f8c1e00017cbb58,nodeLink,There are a lot of nodes people with only 1 interaction.  Jeffrey and Robert are the lynch pins of the network,1,4,,3.633333333,0.89375,49.45,51,Other,Female,2,interesting data presentation,,7
59dc458f77860e000151240e,nodeLink,It seems that the people with multiple connections mostly connect to one person and the chain dead-ends there.  Some of them like Alex and Jeffrey also have few tweets which is interesting for how many connections and followers they have as well as for how old their account is.  It appears that most European people interact with everyone while North American people tend to form small groups of other North Americans like with Rob Lane and Jeffrey.  ,6,1,It was slightly hard to come up with something to comment on but having done all of the previous tasks I was familiar with what the layout meant so I could extrapolate some thoughts.,6.183333333,0.875,44.71666667,36,High School,Male,3,I really liked how intuitive the visualizations were but the colors could have used some more variation especially on the ones that used three shades of blue.  This would help it stand out more and allow you to search visually quicker and easier.,I feel like I could have figured it out without the videos but I appreciated them nonetheless.,6

59fd6e89517dfb00013dacae,nodeLink,Sereno seems to be quite isolated though it is understandable since his account age is very young. I also noticed that Robert has the most popularity among the rest. In fact I noticed that I had selected Robert the most during this survey's tasks.,7,1,,4.183333333,0.6875,40.73333333,21,High School,Male,3,I simply liked the task in general it felt more lively and more interactive than most surveys I've taken. I do not have anything to criticise. There weren't any issues with UI and I would not mind taking a survey similar to this again.,,7
5a135875074b1900012527a9,nodeLink,CSEE is connected to EVis19 but doesn't have any direct connections-it just stops at James and John.

5ad4a1146e74be00014e59d7,nodeLink,Tamara has a relatively low account life but a significant amount of followers especially compared to some other accounts/users,3,4,,1.183333333,0.89375,29.36666667,32,High School,Female,4,It was a neat learning experience these type of visualizations are not something I'm hugely familiar with.

5ae25791af72e0000127b8f7,nodeLink,persons are  way more connected than institutions  .in north america people are more connected than in other parts of the world,4,5,,4.383333333,0.625,64.18333333,36,High School,Female,3,it was fun to see all those graphics and visualize how we connect online ,,7
5b1087bce9270900013c1730,nodeLink,Jack seems to be the only one person from South america.  It has not neighbours from Asia.  There are only three persons from Asia and in total they have very few conections.  In average they are connected only with Europe and North America.  Europeans seem to be the group with larger Account Ages.  Robert and Jeffrey seem to have the largest numbers of neighbours among the network.,7,7,,6.266666667,0.9375,55.46666667,31,PhD,Female,7,I would like to get involved in more surveys like this one,I really enjoyed this survey.  ,7
5b2cc2b57297750001c7a833,nodeLink,There is only one asian person. This person has only one immediate neighbor but is connected to Robery with the most connections in the network and so by association has many (secondary connections),2,6,,2.966666667,0.89375,36.05,21,Bachelors,Female,5,Fun and interesting task to complete,,7
5b2d6013d143660001cc3dd1,nodeLink,No I don't find anything particularly any different from where I started off originally.

5b9081da3e7f4700014685da,nodeLink,There are clusters based around certain accounts (e.g. Robert Rob and Lane). These accounts are almost always run by a person and not a business which is not something I expected. The clusters also feature people from across the world which is another interesting feature,5,4,,1.85,0.71875,33.65,21,High School,Female,4,,,7
5b90bf1a42e93f00017cc9e9,nodeLink,It becomes clear that there are several ways to identify links between individuals when they themselves may not even be aware of one another. This is probably how the US government associates people with terrorism or how facebook suggests friends that you haven't interacted with in years. It also appears that this is a test of a platform that will be provided to help them do this.,7,1,,2.016666667,0.875,22.83333333,28,Bachelors,Male,6,Not bad. Hopefully this doesn't get used for the wrong reasons.,I was able to use the platform with ease after what was an abnormally short training video.,7
5b99bd4d8207940001a0a62a,nodeLink,MViews has so many followers compared to the tweets and the account age but if it is an institution it might make more sense than if the account was a person. Also usually if the account is the center of a very complicated cluster it is a person with a lot of followers. I found that all of the institution accounts are either from North America or Europe.,6,4,,4.95,0.90625,33.15,20,High School,Female,5,,,7
5ba1beaecc5dd00001673e39,nodeLink,Robert Rob Alex and Jeffrey seem to be pretty central figures. However it's interesting that Alex Jeffrey and Rob all have relatively few tweets. Compare that to someone like Teo who has few connections but has tons of tweets and followers.,4,4,,3.233333333,0.96875,33.4,40,Masters,Male,3,Some of the tasks were difficult while many were very easy. The ones that were difficult might have been made easier had there been more ways to select and manipulate the data. I think overall I would probably find something like a spreadsheet more efficient if you know what you're looking for yet seeing a visual depiction of the data does help to see things that you weren't necessarily looking for.  ,,4
5ba8a1d2c16a9c0001497a21,nodeLink,I don't really know what I'm looking for so no I don't see anything surprising or particularly interesting in the network.,1,7,,2.283333333,0.96875,28.71666667,27,Masters,Male,5,I didn't really understand the last question (explore the network freely).,,5

5bd1b30a65466500010241de,nodeLink,There are so many people and institutions in this that I cannot really find anything interesting. Some people like Viau seem to have many followers but little interactions.,1,7,,2.933333333,0.7375,26.55,25,High School,Female,4,Some tasks were quite hard to do because of the many interactions pictured. It was pretty hard to find the information sometimes- but I guess that was the point. Overall I enjoyed the study because it was different from just answering questions like I usually do on Prolific.,The training video explained too much in a too short time. I think I would have been fine without the video and just some training tasks. Or maybe a shorter video that wouldnt go into too much detail.,6
5be26958056ebf0001be62eb,nodeLink,It's interesting to see Robert a very popular and invested account have a very small account like Klaus as one of their neighbors.,4,4,,1.75,0.63125,27.61666667,20,High School,Male,4,,,7

I felt a little confused looking at some of the layouts even though I could understand the labels. It was just difficult to focus on a particular node with dozens of lines everywhere.

5d51bea1502703001757a974,nodeLink,MViews are 2nd in followers (behind Jeffrey) yet only have 1 interaction (with Robert) and have just created their account and have minimal tweets. Meaning that the institution is funneled by Robert most likely. Also Samuel with a rather high account age amount of tweets and followers has only interacted with Jeffrey. Also I find it interesting that there's more Europeans (at 33) compare to Northern Americans (at 27),6,6,,8.716666667,0.76875,30.83333333,20,Bachelors,Male,7,Was a quite fairly interesting data ''game'' useful for teaching children in primary school etc. how strong social media is and the influence certain people can have. Basically youÛªre a node in a network. Of course thatÛªs even more true now that we have social media. YouÛªll know a thousand people at least over the course of your life and theyÛªll know a thousand people each and that puts you one person away from a million and two persons away from a billion. And so thatÛªs how youÛªre connected and the things you do is like dropping a stone in a pond. The ripples move outward and they affect things in ways that you canÛªt fully comprehend.,,7

5d542b4c3e92110001eda194,nodeLink,Despite Mara having many followers there are few neighbors shown and  James has much fewer followers but more neighbors. The more I look there are quite a lot of nodes with few followers but many neighbors and some with a lot of followers but few neighbors.,6,4,I don't feel like confident/difficult really applied to this question personally so I put 4 because it was vague and I had to think about it more than some of the other questions and confident because it doesn't seem like a right or wrong answer,2.7,0.90625,31.78333333,26,Bachelors,other,5,I wish there was a little more color differentiation between green and blue (I'm not colorblind but for some reason it was hard for me to see the difference right  away when I was just looking at the network). Also I wish there was a little more differentiation in the bar charts that was more intuitive like a little person symbol for followers and a little bird for tweets. Also a little house for institutions and a little person for people or something like that.,It was useful for node/edges/data visualizations in general but I wasn't expecting how complex some of the visualizations would get from just the training video. I wish it went into that a little more so I would be more familiar with this specific set of data.,5

5d55b7ef6a0f930017202336,nodeLink,It is surprising the the network has an obvious 'nucleus' of contributors and then such an array of outliers. For example Helwig only interacts with Thomas. Unsurprisingly those outliers have the fewest followers and often tweets. However looking towards the centre of the diagram - where you see the most nodes you would expect to see a correlation between tweets and follows (e.g. like Robert) but that isn't always the case. Tamara MViews and EEyes have lots of tweets but not a correspondingly high number of followers. Most users tend to be from North America or Europe - there also tend to be geographical clusters. Maybe time difference and real-time interactions still have a bearing in the digital age?It also appears institutions have fewer followers overall than people. Interesting!,4,2,Not sure about confidence on this one as it's a freetext field but there was plenty of interesting information that could be drawn out from the diagram when you look around!,5.833333333,0.6875,34.46666667,31,Bachelors,Female,2,I really enjoyed this task - thank you - it's made me more keen to learn about data visualisation and how we can make statistics beautiful and interesting. ,Useful but quick!
