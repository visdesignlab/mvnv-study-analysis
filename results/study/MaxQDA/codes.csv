no-insight,If there is anything surprising or particularly interesting i don't seem to be able to find it.
topology-attribute-insight,Teo has one of the most followers but very few interatctions.

topology-insight,Jeffery and Robert do a lot of interacting with everyone including between themself.
topology-insight,There are a lot of accounts whom rarely ever interact with anything.
topology-insight,Steven Evan Jo and Till have only ever had 1 interaction and they have all been with Lane.
general-comment,I found this network to be fairly interesting and how it works to be easy to learn overall.
topology-attribute-insight,Jeffrey has very few tweets but the most followers and interactions with a lot of accounts.
question-insight,I also thought it was interesting that a person could have more followers than tweets. How's that possible? What are they doing to attract people?

attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,I see that the activity in the EU is broader and I think it is more real by the average that they show of tweets against the number of followers and how I see the interactions on the sheet...In the US it looks like a pattern.
topology-attribute-insight,The reported cluster has as many EU as NA members
attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,NA members tend to have more followers EU members make up most of the lowest-follower users--still the two continents seem to have a pretty even spread among account age.

You can't get that many followers just by interacting with one or two users so it shows that you had to cut the graph off somewhere because otherwise it would go on forever.
