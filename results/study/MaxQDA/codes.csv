no-insight,If there is anything surprising or particularly interesting i don't seem to be able to find it.
topology-attribute-insight,Teo has one of the most followers but very few interatctions.
attribute-insight\incorrect-attribute-insight,I do see that asia has less accounts than institutions in this data presented
topology-insight,Jeffery and Robert do a lot of interacting with everyone including between themself.
topology-insight,There are a lot of accounts whom rarely ever interact with anything.
topology-insight,Steven Evan Jo and Till have only ever had 1 interaction and they have all been with Lane.
general-comment,I found this network to be fairly interesting and how it works to be easy to learn overall.
topology-attribute-insight,Jeffrey has very few tweets but the most followers and interactions with a lot of accounts.
question-insight,I also thought it was interesting that a person could have more followers than tweets. How's that possible? What are they doing to attract people?
attribute-insight\ranked-attribute-insight,MViews has the 2nd youngest account age however it has the 4th largest follower count even though it also has the least number of tweets
attribute-insight\ranked-attribute-insight,Jeffrey has very few tweets but the most followers and interactions with a lot of accounts.

attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,Majority of accounts reside from either Europe or North America.
attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,Most of the 'subjects' are people from either North America or Europe and overall they most 'subjects' have a large following.
attribute-insight\ranked-attribute-insight,1. that some nodes with the most followers actually have much fewer tweets than those with far fewer followers
attribute-insight\across-node-attribute-comparison,institutions have much fewer tweets in general than a persons account
attribute-insight\within-node-attribute-comparison,I also thought it was interesting that a person could have more followers than tweets. How's that possible?
attribute-insight\across-node-attribute-comparison,1. that some nodes with the most followers actually have much fewer tweets than those with far fewer followers
attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,I see that the activity in the EU is broader and I think it is more real by the average that they show of tweets against the number of followers and how I see the interactions on the sheet...In the US it looks like a pattern.
topology-attribute-insight,The reported cluster has as many EU as NA members
attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,NA members tend to have more followers EU members make up most of the lowest-follower users--still the two continents seem to have a pretty even spread among account age.
attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,nstitutions have a better chance of having a lot of followers despite a short account life or tweet quantity.
attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,Institutions seem to have a lot of followers in comparison to how many tweets they have

attribute-insight\single-attribute-insight,It doesn't seem like there's a large amount of users of twitter from Asia on this chart.

attribute-insight\multiple-attribute-insight,More often than not the more popular Person's have a lot of tweets or account age
attribute-insight\within-node-attribute-comparison,More often than not the more popular Person's have a lot of tweets or account age
topology-attribute-insight,Interesting that people with only a few interactions also got very high follower number.
topology-attribute-insight,Also that more interactions in EU than NA
meaningless-insight,EU is on the bottom of the follower number list
meaningless-insight,Also that more interactions in EU than NA
attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,Tweet number is low for new accounts but otherwise not related to any other attribute.
general-comment,cluster is a very interesting way to sort. seeing all the people that interact with each at the same time seems to be very useful.
no-insight,I cannot see anything out of the ordinary!
attribute-insight\single-attribute-insight,Few people from South America
attribute-insight\single-attribute-insight,Few institutions
attribute-insight\single-attribute-insight,Most people from Europe

attribute-insight\ranked-attribute-insight,I find it interesting that Jeffrey has the most followers and a decent number of neighbors at 27
topology-attribute-insight,I also think it's interesting his neighbors are primarily North American and European and mostly persons and not institutions

attribute-insight\multiple-attribute-insight,I also think it's interesting his neighbors are primarily North American and European and mostly persons and not institutions
question-insight,This makes me wonder of persons in developed countries have more access to Twitter and if this is why Jeffrey's followers consist of persons from that region.

attribute-insight\single-attribute-insight,All of the non-person accounts are listed as institutions
attribute-insight\single-attribute-insight,It's also interesting how there is only one South American account within this set of data.
no-insight,Unfortunetely I did not find anything suprising me. But generally all of this stuff is quite interesting.

attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,Mostly Europeans
topology-insight,Alex and Robert together being connected to what seems to be about half of the networ
topology-attribute-insight,It does seem a bit odd that Jon Jeffrey Alex and Rob have such large networks with their lower than average tweeting
topology-insight,Robert is very active
topology-insight,Klaus is very inactive
topology-insight,Robert and Jeffery are the two most important nodes in the graph.
question-insight,I thought there would be more institutions that take importance than people

attribute-insight\overview-attribute-insight,How little represented that Asia and South America is as a whole.
no-insight,I don't see anything that stands out.
topology-attribute-insight,Some users on the outskirts of the graph (i.e. having a small number of edges) have a disproportionately large number of followers. You can't get that many followers just by interacting with one or two users so it shows that you had to cut the graph off somewhere because otherwise it would go on forever.
topology-attribute-insight,alex seems to have had a lot of interactions with various nodes but not many likes. Indicating he may tweet mention or retweet a lot and be very active.
attribute-insight\within-node-attribute-comparison,Eytan and IDL have many followers but very few tweetsas do Wood and Ben.

topology-attribute-insight,"From what I can tell Robert and Jeffrey appear to form the two major ""hubs"" of this social network both with the highest number of connections and several that overlap. There are other smaller hubs like Rob and Lane with similar features. Each of these share a larger account age compared to less connected people in the network and boast high follower counts too."

topology-insight,Andrea and Mandy are two people who do not have much social influence but are connected with him.
attribute-insight\within-node-attribute-comparison,I would have assumed that a high follower count would also mean a high tweets count; however in many instances I can see that this is not true. Most notably MViews stands out.

topology-attribute-insight,Klaus has many connections but few tweets and followers. He also has an old account.
topology-insight,There are a lot of nodes people with only 1 interaction.  Jeffrey and Robert are the lynch pins of the network
topology-insight,It seems that the people with multiple connections mostly connect to one person and the chain dead-ends there.
topology-attribute-insight,Some of them like Alex and Jeffrey also have few tweets which is interesting for how many connections and followers they have as well as for how old their account is.
attribute-insight\multiple-attribute-insight,Some of them like Alex and Jeffrey also have few tweets which is interesting for how many connections and followers they have as well as for how old their account is.
topology-attribute-insight,It appears that most European people interact with everyone while North American people tend to form small groups of other North Americans like with Rob Lane and Jeffrey.
no-insight,Can't spot anything aurprising
topology-attribute-insight,Sereno seems to be quite isolated though it is understandable since his account age is very young.
topology-insight,I also noticed that Robert has the most popularity among the rest. In fact I noticed that I had selected Robert the most during this survey's tasks.
