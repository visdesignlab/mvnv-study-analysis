Basically you’re a node in a network. Of course that’s even more true now that we have social media. You’ll know a thousand people at least over the course of your life and they’ll know a thousand people each and that puts you one person away from a million and two persons away from a billion. And so that’s how you’re connected and the things you do is like dropping a stone in a pond. The ripples move outward and they affect things in ways that you can’t fully comprehend.,,7
