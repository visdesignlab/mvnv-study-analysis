Although there were some easy questions the hard questions were very hard. It was kind of stressful for me because I didn't know how to answer and I didn't want to answer wrong. ,I was following for the first half of the video but I had to watch the second half twice. It was quite confusing as I don't know very much about multivariate networks. It would have been useful if the help button available during the tasks had more information. I forgot what certain terms meant so I wasn't sure how to perform some of the tasks. ,4,54.1

Also a little house for institutions and a little person for people or something like that.,It was useful for node/edges/data visualizations in general but I wasn't expecting how complex some of the visualizations would get from just the training video.

For example Helwig only interacts with Thomas. Unsurprisingly those outliers have the fewest followers and often tweets.

Tamara MViews and EEyes have lots of tweets but not a correspondingly high number of followers. Most users tend to be from North America or Europe - there also tend to be geographical clusters.
