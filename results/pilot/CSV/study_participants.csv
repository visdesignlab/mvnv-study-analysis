It is easier to learn something when you are solving a problem and applying the knowledge knowing exactly its use. My biggest issue was actually related to the wording of some questions and not being certain I was replying with what was asked. But I tried to respond to the best of my knowledge taking into account what I understood (I also mentioned if I was afraid of having misunderstood the question please believe me it was not willful lack of attention but genuine confusion!),The videos were really useful. I feel like it would have been impossible for me to answer some of the questions without them.,7,40.81666666666667,1080,1920,24,1080,24,1920,Tue Aug 20 2019 16:42:22 GMT+0100 (Hora de verão da Europa Ocidental),5ca238f0fd2f4e00184ec34c
